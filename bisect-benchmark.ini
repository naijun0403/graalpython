[bisect-benchmark]
# This is the configuration file for bisecting benchmark jobs in the CI.
# Usage:
# - Create a temporary branch based on the main branch (or the bad commit)
# - Fill in this configuration file, commit the changes and push it
# - The push command output should give you a link to create a PR. Open it, but
#   don't create a PR. Instead, you should execute the job on your commit using
#   "Actions->Shcedule CI jobs" in the commit list. You may need to wait a bit
#   for the job enumerator to run before it shows the job list. Run the
#   "bisect-benchmark" job.
# - Wait for the jobs to finish. You should get an email when it's done

# When you're unsure about the config and would like to try it locally to see
# the first iteration or you would like to debug a failing build, you can use
# the configuration locally using:
# BISECT_BENCHMARK_CONFIG=bisect-benchmark.ini mx bisect-benchmark

# The command to build particular configuration. You can copy paste this from
# the benchmark job log. Don't worry about sforceimports, the script takes care
# of that
build_command = mx --dy /compiler build

# The commmand to run the particular benchmark on the configuration. You can
# copy paste this from the benchmark job log. Make sure you replace the '*'
# wildcard with a single benchmark, the script only supports bisecting a single
# benchmark at a time. Note the command typically ends with "--" and the
# "-XX ..." list is not part of the command, that's already part of the output
benchmark_command = mx --dy /compiler benchmark micro:try-except-simple

# The first known "bad" merge commit for bisection. Try to use long commit
# SHAs, the CI cache has higher probability of short SHAs being ambiguous
bad = 1234deadbeef

# The last known "good" merge commit for bisection
good = 1234cafebabe

# Whether to checkout graal-enterprise
enterprise = true

# Which result parameter should be used for comparisons, one of BEST, WORST,
# AVG (all runs), AVG (no warmup), WORKS (bench failures are treated as
# regressions)
